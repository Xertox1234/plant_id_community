# Configure IP Spoofing Protection

**CVSS**: 5.3 (Medium)

## Problem

`USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` not explicitly set - defaults may allow IP spoofing in rate limiting/account lockout.

## Solution

```python
# settings.py
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = False  # Dev
# Production: USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True with trusted proxy
```

**Effort**: 15 minutes

## Resolution

**Status**: RESOLVED
**Date**: 2025-10-27

### Changes Made:
1. Added `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` configuration to `/Users/williamtower/projects/plant_id_community/backend/plant_community_backend/settings.py` (lines 842-862)
   - Set to `False` by default for development (no reverse proxy)
   - Environment variable support via `config('USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST', default=False, cast=bool)`
   - Comprehensive documentation explaining:
     - CVSS 5.3 security risk
     - Impact on rate limiting, account lockout, ALLOWED_HOSTS, and CSRF protection
     - Production deployment checklist (3 steps)
     - Reverse proxy configuration requirements

2. Added documentation to `/Users/williamtower/projects/plant_id_community/backend/.env.example` (lines 110-114)
   - Example configuration with security warning
   - Clear guidance for development vs production
   - Reference to trusted reverse proxy requirement

### Verification:
- Django settings validation: PASSED (0 issues)
- Configuration loads successfully with no errors
- Default value: `False` (secure for development)

### Security Impact:
- Prevents IP spoofing attacks in development (direct connections)
- Provides clear path for production deployment behind trusted reverse proxies
- Protects rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms from bypass
- Maintains ALLOWED_HOSTS and CSRF protection integrity
