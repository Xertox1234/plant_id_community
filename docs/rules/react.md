# React (web) — binding rules

Compact checklist auto-injected before edits. Long-form:
`web/docs/patterns/react-typescript.md`, `.../tailwind.md`.

- **Import router hooks from `react-router-dom`, never `react-router`.**
  `import { useNavigate } from 'react-router'` is a silent runtime failure
  (`Cannot read properties of undefined`).
- **Debounce/timer IDs go in `useRef`, not `useState`.** `useState` re-renders on
  every update, recreates the callback, and leaks the timer on unmount.
- **Sanitize HTML with DOMPurify** before any `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- **Send CSRF headers** on state-changing requests (`X-CSRFToken`).
- Clean up effects — abort fetches, clear timers, remove listeners on unmount.
- Tailwind CSS 4 conventions; no hardcoded hex colors where a token exists.
- **Render `error.message`, not the error object.** `String({message,code})` is the
  literal `[object Object]`; a `sanitize*` helper that returns non-strings unchanged
  won't save you — pass the string field in.
