# 🎉 Firebase Key Rotation - NEARLY COMPLETE

**Date**: November 14, 2025
**Issue**: #142 - Firebase API Keys Exposed
**Status**: Configuration & Deployment Complete ✅ | Testing & Audit Pending ⏳

---

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. New Firebase App Registrations ✅

- **Android App ID**: `1:190351417275:android:53aa5e82b6e221ad69ae9e` (NEW)
- **iOS App ID**: `1:190351417275:ios:41590963ad4f6bd969ae9e` (NEW)
- **Old compromised apps**: DELETED from Firebase Console
  - Android old: `b0ff3bc42c952da769ae9e` ❌ REVOKED
  - iOS old: `cde2ebc37ca035de69ae9e` ❌ REVOKED

### 2. Configuration Files Updated ✅

- ✅ `.env` file updated with new Firebase app IDs
- ✅ `google-services.json` copied to `android/app/`
- ✅ `GoogleService-Info.plist` copied to `ios/Runner/`
- ✅ `.env` file properly gitignored (verified not tracked)

### 3. Firebase Security Rules Deployed ✅

- ✅ **Firestore rules**: Deployed successfully

  ```
  ✔  firestore: released rules firebase/firestore.rules to cloud.firestore
  ```

- ✅ **Storage rules**: Deployed successfully

  ```
  ✔  storage: released rules firebase/storage.rules to firebase.storage
  ```

**Security Features Active:**

- 🔐 Authentication required for all operations
- 🔐 Ownership checks enforce user can only access their own data
- 🔐 Deny-all default for unmatched paths
- 🔐 Image validation (10MB limit, type checking) for storage

### 4. Important Security Note 📋

**Why API keys are the same:**

- Firebase API keys are **PROJECT-level**, not app-level
- They're public identifiers (meant to be embedded in apps)
- **Real security comes from Firebase Security Rules** (now deployed ✅)
- By deleting old app registrations, the old apps can no longer connect

## ⏳ REMAINING TASKS (Manual Steps Required)

### Task 1: Test Flutter App on iOS & Android

**iOS Simulator Test:**

```bash
cd /Users/williamtower/projects/plant_id_community/plant_community_mobile
flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator
flutter run -d ios
```

**Android Emulator Test:**

```bash
flutter emulators --launch Medium_Phone_API_36.1
flutter run -d android
```

**What to Verify:**

- ✅ App launches without Firebase errors
- ✅ No exceptions about missing Firebase configuration
- ✅ Firebase services connect properly (if you have any Firebase features implemented)

---

### Task 2: Audit Firebase Logs (30-Day Review)

**🔍 Check for Unauthorized Access:**

#### Firestore Activity

1. Visit: <https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plant-community-prod/firestore/usage>
2. Review graph for past 30 days
3. **Look for red flags:**
   - ❌ Unusual spikes in document reads/writes
   - ❌ Activity during hours you weren't using the app
   - ❌ Operations from unexpected geographic locations

#### Storage Activity

1. Visit: <https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plant-community-prod/storage/usage>
2. Review bandwidth and storage usage
3. **Look for red flags:**
   - ❌ Large unexpected file uploads
   - ❌ Bandwidth spikes
   - ❌ Unknown file names or paths

#### Authentication Logs

1. Visit: <https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plant-community-prod/authentication/users>
2. Review user creation dates
3. **Look for red flags:**
   - ❌ Multiple accounts created in short time
   - ❌ Suspicious email patterns
   - ❌ Accounts created during odd hours

**If no red flags found**: Document "No unauthorized access detected" ✅

### Task 3: Update GitHub Issue #142

Once testing and audit are complete:

```bash
# Add completion comment to issue
gh issue comment 142 --body "✅ Firebase key rotation complete:

## Configuration
- New Android app ID: \`53aa5e82b6e221ad69ae9e\`
- New iOS app ID: \`41590963ad4f6bd969ae9e\`
- Old compromised apps deleted from Firebase Console

## Deployment
- Firestore security rules deployed ✅
- Storage security rules deployed ✅
- Security rules verified in Firebase Console

## Security Audit
- Firebase logs reviewed for past 30 days
- No unauthorized access detected
- Testing complete on iOS and Android simulators

## Files Updated
- \`.env\` file updated (NOT committed to git)
- \`google-services.json\` updated
- \`GoogleService-Info.plist\` updated

Old app registrations have been revoked. New apps with fresh IDs are active."

# Close the issue
gh issue close 142
```

## 📊 Final Security Status

| Component | Status | Verification |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Code security (flutter_dotenv) | ✅ Complete | Uses environment variables |
| App registrations rotated | ✅ Complete | New IDs, old apps deleted |
| Firestore security rules | ✅ Deployed | Authentication + ownership checks |
| Storage security rules | ✅ Deployed | Image validation + size limits |
| Configuration files | ✅ Updated | New files in place |
| .env gitignore | ✅ Verified | Not tracked in git |
| **Testing** | ⏳ **PENDING** | **Manual iOS/Android test required** |
| **Log audit** | ⏳ **PENDING** | **Review Firebase Console logs** |
| **Issue closure** | ⏳ **PENDING** | **Update GitHub issue** |

## 🔐 What Changed vs. What Stayed the Same

### ✅ Changed (Security Improved)

1. **App IDs rotated**: Old apps can no longer connect to Firebase
2. **Security rules deployed**: Authentication and authorization now enforced
3. **Configuration updated**: New app IDs in `.env` and config files

### ℹ️ Stayed the Same (Expected)

1. **API keys**: PROJECT-level identifiers (same across all apps in project)
2. **Project ID**: `plant-community-prod` (unchanged)
3. **Storage bucket**: `plant-community-prod.firebasestorage.app` (unchanged)

**Why this is secure:** Firebase API keys are meant to be public. Security comes from the deployed security rules, not key secrecy.
