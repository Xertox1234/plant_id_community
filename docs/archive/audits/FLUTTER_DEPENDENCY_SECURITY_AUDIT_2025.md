---

## HTTP Client

### dio

| Package | Current | Latest | Upgrade Type | Risk |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------|------|
| dio | 5.8.1 | **5.9.0** | PATCH | LOW |

**Published 2 months ago (August 2025)**

**Security Analysis:**
- **No specific CVEs found** for dio package
- Common implementation issues to watch:
  - SSL/TLS certificate validation (ensure proper implementation)
  - Certificate pinning can be bypassed with Frida scripts
  - Avoid disabling certificate validation in production

**Best Practices:**
```dart
// GOOD - Proper certificate validation
final dio = Dio(BaseOptions(
  validateCertificate: true,  // Default, don't disable
));

// BAD - Security risk
final dio = Dio(BaseOptions(
  validateCertificate: false,  // DO NOT DO THIS
));
```

**1. Dart SDK Downgrade to Stable**
```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
environment:
  sdk: ^3.9.0  # DOWN from ^3.10.0-162.1.beta
```

**Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Update pubspec.yaml (above)
# 2. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Verify Dart version
dart --version  # Should show 3.9.x

# 4. Test application
flutter test
flutter run
```

### PHASE 1 (HIGH PRIORITY) - Firebase Upgrade

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Risk:** Medium-High (breaking changes)

**Step 1: Backup and Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b upgrade/firebase-4.x
git commit -am "Checkpoint before Firebase upgrade"
```

**Step 2: Update pubspec.yaml**
```yaml
dependencies:
  # Firebase - ALL packages must upgrade together
  firebase_core: ^4.2.0      # Up from 3.8.1
  firebase_auth: ^6.1.1      # Up from 5.3.3
  cloud_firestore: ^6.0.3    # Up from 5.5.2
  firebase_storage: ^13.0.3  # Up from 12.3.6
```

**Step 3: Update Native Projects**

**Android (`android/app/build.gradle`):**
```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 23  // UP from 21 (REQUIRED for Firebase 4.x)
        targetSdkVersion 34
    }
}
```

**iOS (`ios/Podfile`):**
```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'  # UP from 11.0 (REQUIRED for Firebase 4.x)
```

**Step 4: Clean and Install**
```bash
# Clean Flutter
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Clean iOS (if on macOS)
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..

# Clean Android
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..

# Run app
flutter run
```

**Step 5: Code Migration**

Review changelogs and fix breaking changes:
- https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core/changelog
- https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth/changelog
- https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore/changelog
- https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_storage/changelog

**Common Breaking Changes to Fix:**
```dart
// DEPRECATED (Firebase Auth 5.x)
ActionCodeSettings(dynamicLinkDomain: 'example.com')  // REMOVE

// DEPRECATED
MicrosoftAuthProvider.credential()  // Use alternative

// DEPRECATED
FirebaseAuth.instanceFor(persistence: ...)  // Remove persistence parameter
```

**Step 6: Test Thoroughly**
```bash
flutter test                    # Unit tests
flutter run -d ios             # iOS testing
flutter run -d android         # Android testing
flutter build apk --release    # Android release build
flutter build ios --release    # iOS release build
```

---

### PHASE 2 (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - Riverpod 3.0 Upgrade

**Timeline:** 1 week
**Risk:** Medium (breaking changes in state management)

**Step 1: Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b upgrade/riverpod-3.0
```

**Step 2: Update pubspec.yaml**
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_riverpod: ^3.0.3      # Up from 2.6.1
  riverpod_annotation: ^3.0.3   # Up from 2.6.1

dev_dependencies:
  riverpod_generator: ^3.0.3    # Up from 2.6.3
  build_runner: ^2.10.0         # Up from 2.4.16
```

**Step 3: Install and Regenerate**
```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Step 4: Fix Breaking Changes**

Follow migration guide: https://riverpod.dev/docs/3.0_migration

**Common Fixes:**
```dart
// BEFORE (Riverpod 2.x)
@riverpod
class CounterNotifier extends AutoDisposeNotifier<int> {  // Remove AutoDispose
  @override
  int build() => 0;
}

// AFTER (Riverpod 3.0)
@riverpod
class CounterNotifier extends Notifier<int> {  // Just Notifier
  @override
  int build() => 0;
}

// BEFORE (Riverpod 2.x)
class MyNotifier extends FamilyNotifier<int, String> { ... }  // Remove Family

// AFTER (Riverpod 3.0)
class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> { ... }  // Just Notifier

// BEFORE (Riverpod 2.x)
ref.state  // On ProviderRef

// AFTER (Riverpod 3.0)
state  // Direct property on Notifier
```

**Step 5: Test State Management**
```bash
flutter test
flutter run
# Test all features that use Riverpod providers
```
