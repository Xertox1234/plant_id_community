## ⏳ REMAINING TASKS

### Task 1: Audit Firebase Logs (Manual - Firebase Console Required)

**Check these areas for unauthorized access (past 30 days)**:

#### Firestore Activity
URL: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plant-community-prod/firestore/usage

**Look for**:
- ❌ Unusual spikes in document reads/writes
- ❌ Activity during off-hours
- ❌ Operations from unexpected locations

#### Storage Activity
URL: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plant-community-prod/storage/usage

**Look for**:
- ❌ Large unexpected file uploads
- ❌ Bandwidth spikes
- ❌ Unknown file paths

#### Authentication
URL: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plant-community-prod/authentication/users

**Look for**:
- ❌ Mass account creation
- ❌ Suspicious email patterns
- ❌ Accounts created during odd hours

---

### Task 2: Close GitHub Issue #142

Once log audit is complete, run:

```bash
gh issue comment 142 --body "✅ Firebase app rotation complete:

## New App Registrations
- Android app ID: \`53aa5e82b6e221ad69ae9e\` (NEW)
- iOS app ID: \`41590963ad4f6bd969ae9e\` (NEW)
- Old compromised apps deleted

## Security Deployment
- Firestore rules deployed ✅
- Storage rules deployed ✅
- Configuration files updated ✅

## Verification
- Firebase SDK loading correctly
- No configuration errors in build logs
- Security rules active in Firebase Console

## Log Audit
- [ADD RESULTS HERE after manual audit]
- No unauthorized access detected: [YES/NO]

The old app registrations have been revoked. New apps with fresh IDs are now active."

gh issue close 142
```

## 🔐 Important Security Notes

### Why API Keys Are the Same
Firebase API keys are PROJECT-level identifiers (not app-level secrets):
- Same keys are used across all apps in a Firebase project
- They're public identifiers meant to be embedded in apps
- **Security comes from Firebase Security Rules** (now deployed ✅)

### What Actually Changed
- **App IDs changed**: Old apps can no longer connect
- **Security rules deployed**: Authentication + authorization now enforced
- **Old app registrations deleted**: Revoked access even with same API keys

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Complete Firebase log audit** (links above)
   - Check for unusual activity patterns
   - Verify no unauthorized access

2. **Update GitHub Issue #142**
   - Add audit results
   - Close issue

3. **Optional: Address iOS build issue**
   - `Command CompileStoryboard failed` (unrelated to Firebase)
   - This is an Xcode storyboard compilation issue
   - Firebase configuration is valid and working
