## Use Case Analysis for Plant ID Community

### Web App (Blog + Forum) - **Supabase Advantage**
- **Why?**: Blog and forum data is inherently relational
- Categories, tags, comments, user relationships
- Complex queries (search, filtering, sorting)
- SQL is natural for this structure

### Mobile App (Plant ID) - **Firebase Advantage**
- **Why?**: Plant ID records are document-based
- Better offline support
- Simpler real-time updates
- Official Flutter support

---

## Hybrid Approach Consideration

### Option: Use Both
**Django/Wagtail + Supabase** for web (blog/forum)
**Flutter + Firebase** for mobile (plant ID)

**Pros:**
- Best tool for each job
- Wagtail already uses PostgreSQL (compatible with Supabase)
- Flutter works great with Firebase
- Can sync critical data between them

**Cons:**
- More complexity
- Two databases to manage
- Authentication sync complexity
- Higher operational overhead

**Verdict**: **Not recommended** for solo developer. Choose one.

---

## Decision Matrix

### Choose Firebase If:
✅ You want the best Flutter support
✅ Real-time features are critical
✅ You prefer NoSQL/document model
✅ You value mature, proven technology
✅ Don't mind vendor lock-in
✅ Want excellent mobile-first features

### Choose Supabase If:
✅ You prefer SQL/relational databases
✅ Cost predictability is important
✅ You want open source
✅ Exit strategy/portability matters
✅ You're comfortable with PostgreSQL
✅ Web features are priority
✅ You might want to self-host later

## Recommendation for Plant ID Community

### **Recommended: Firebase** (with caveat)

**Primary Reasons:**
1. **Flutter First-Class Support**: Official packages, extensive docs
2. **Mobile Focus**: Plant ID functionality is mobile-first
3. **Real-time**: Easy real-time updates for notifications
4. **Proven**: Mature technology with large community
5. **Unified Auth**: Single auth system across web and mobile
6. **Wagtail Integration**: Can connect Django/Wagtail to Firebase

**Caveat**:
- Monitor costs carefully
- Use Firebase for auth and plant ID data
- Use Django's SQLite/PostgreSQL for blog/forum content (Wagtail's native DB)
- This gives you best of both worlds

### Architecture Approach:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         WEB APP (Django/Wagtail)    │
│  ├─ Blog (Wagtail DB - PostgreSQL) │
│  ├─ Forum (Django DB - PostgreSQL) │
│  └─ Auth (Firebase Auth)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↕
         ┌───────────────┐
         │   Firebase    │
         │  - Auth       │
         │  - Firestore  │
         │  - Storage    │
         └───────────────┘
                 ↕
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      MOBILE APP (Flutter)           │
│  ├─ Plant ID (Firebase/Firestore)  │
│  ├─ Camera & Upload                 │
│  ├─ Auth (Firebase Auth)            │
│  └─ Read Blog/Forum (API from Web)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Setup
1. Set up Firebase project
2. Configure Firebase Auth (web + mobile)
3. Keep Django/Wagtail with PostgreSQL for blog/forum
4. Connect Django to Firebase Auth (using Firebase Admin SDK)

### Phase 2: Mobile Development
1. Flutter app with Firebase SDK
2. Plant ID features using Firestore
3. Image uploads to Firebase Storage

### Phase 3: Integration
1. REST API from Django for blog/forum read access
2. Shared authentication via Firebase
3. Webhooks/Cloud Functions for cross-platform sync if needed

---

## Final Verdict

**Firebase** is the recommended choice with the hybrid approach:
- **Firebase**: Authentication + Plant ID data + Mobile storage
- **PostgreSQL** (via Django): Blog + Forum content (Wagtail's native)

This gives you:
✅ Best Flutter support
✅ Wagtail's preferred database for CMS
✅ Cost optimization (blog/forum data in PostgreSQL)
✅ Single auth system
✅ Flexibility for future changes
