## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not keep the PWA?
**A**: We want native mobile apps for better camera integration, offline support, and platform-specific features. The web will focus on blog/forum where it excels.

### Q: Will we lose any existing features?
**A**: No. All features will be preserved. Some will move to mobile (camera plant ID), others stay on web (blog/forum).

### Q: Why Firebase if it has vendor lock-in?
**A**: Superior Flutter support, mature technology, and we're using a hybrid approach to minimize lock-in. Blog/forum data stays in PostgreSQL.

### Q: Can I change these plans?
**A**: Absolutely! These are living documents. Update them as you learn and make better decisions.

### Q: What if I want to use Supabase instead?
**A**: You can! The architecture supports it. You'd need to use community Flutter packages and adjust the auth integration.

- **Technology Stack**: Update when versions change
- **Master Plan**: Update weekly during active development
- **API Docs**: Update with each API change
- **Database Schema**: Update when schema changes

### Version Control
All documents are version controlled in Git. Major changes should:
1. Be documented in commit messages
