"""
Forum signal handlers for cache invalidation.

Connects to Django model lifecycle signals to maintain cache freshness.
Follows project logging standards with [CACHE] bracketed prefix.

Signal Sources:
- django.db.models.signals.post_save: When thread/post is created/updated
- django.db.models.signals.post_delete: When thread/post is deleted

Pattern:
- Import services, not models (avoid circular imports)
- Log all invalidations for monitoring
- Keep handlers lightweight (cache operations are fast)
- Signal receivers registered in apps.py ready() method
