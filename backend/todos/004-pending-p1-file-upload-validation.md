# Add File Upload Validation with Magic Bytes (CRITICAL)

## Problem Statement

File type validation relies on Content-Type header which can be spoofed by attackers:

```python
# simple_views.py:91-96
allowed_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
if image_file.content_type not in allowed_types:
    return Response({...}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

**Impact:**
- Content-Type header can be spoofed by attacker
- Malicious files (executables, scripts) can be uploaded with fake Content-Type
- Potential RCE (Remote Code Execution) if files are processed without validation
- Exploitability: HIGH

**Proof of Concept:**
```bash
# Attacker uploads malicious file with spoofed Content-Type
curl -X POST /api/plant-identification/identify/ \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "image=@malicious.exe;type=image/jpeg"
```

## Findings

- Discovered during security audit by security-sentinel agent
- Location: `/backend/apps/plant_identification/api/simple_views.py:91-96`
- Severity: HIGH (OWASP A03:2021 - Injection)
- Similar vulnerability in all file upload endpoints

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Multi-Layer Validation (RECOMMENDED)
- **Pros**: Defense in depth, catches all attack vectors
- **Cons**: Additional dependency (python-magic)
- **Effort**: Medium (1 hour)
- **Risk**: Low (standard security practice)

**Implementation:**
```python
# 1. Install dependency
# requirements.txt
python-magic==0.4.27

# 2. Create validation utility
# apps/plant_identification/utils/file_validation.py

from PIL import Image
import magic
from rest_framework.exceptions import ValidationError

def validate_image_file(image_file):
    """
    Validate image file using multiple methods for security.

    Performs three layers of validation:
    1. Content-Type header check (first line of defense)
    2. File magic bytes verification (more reliable)
    3. PIL image open and verify (ensures complete valid image)

    Args:
        image_file: Django UploadedFile object

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If file is not a valid image

    Returns:
        True if validation passes
    """
    allowed_content_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
    allowed_magic_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']

    # Layer 1: Check Content-Type header (fast but spoofable)
    if image_file.content_type not in allowed_content_types:
        raise ValidationError(
            f"Invalid Content-Type: {image_file.content_type}. "
            f"Allowed: {', '.join(allowed_content_types)}"
        )

    # Layer 2: Verify file magic bytes (more reliable)
    image_file.seek(0)
    file_header = image_file.read(2048)  # Read first 2KB for magic detection
    image_file.seek(0)  # Reset for later processing

    mime = magic.from_buffer(file_header, mime=True)
    if mime not in allowed_magic_types:
        raise ValidationError(
            f"File content does not match declared type. "
            f"Detected: {mime}, Expected: {image_file.content_type}"
        )

    # Layer 3: Try to open with PIL (ensures it's a complete, valid image)
    try:
        img = Image.open(image_file)
        img.verify()  # Verify it's a complete image
        image_file.seek(0)  # Reset for later processing
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValidationError(f"Invalid or corrupted image file: {str(e)}")

    return True

# 3. Use in views
# apps/plant_identification/api/simple_views.py

from apps.plant_identification.utils.file_validation import validate_image_file

@api_view(['POST'])
def identify_plant(request):
    image_file = request.FILES.get('image')

    # Validate file before processing
    try:
        validate_image_file(image_file)
    except ValidationError as e:
        return Response({
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e)
        }, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

    # Proceed with identification...
```

### Option 2: Extension Validation Only (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- **Pros**: Simple, no dependencies
- **Cons**: Easy to bypass (rename malicious.exe to malicious.jpg)
- **Effort**: Small (15 minutes)
- **Risk**: HIGH (insufficient protection)

## Recommended Action

**Implement Option 1** - Multi-layer validation with python-magic

## Technical Details

- **Affected Files**:
  - `/backend/apps/plant_identification/api/simple_views.py:91-96`
  - `/backend/requirements.txt` (add python-magic)
  - NEW: `/backend/apps/plant_identification/utils/file_validation.py`

- **Related Components**:
  - All file upload endpoints
  - Image processing pipeline
  - External API integrations (Plant.id, PlantNet)

- **System Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install libmagic

  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install libmagic1

  # Python package
  pip install python-magic
  ```

- **Database Changes**: No

## Resources

- Security audit report: `/backend/docs/development/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- Agent report: security-sentinel (Finding #9)
- OWASP File Upload: https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload
- python-magic docs: https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] python-magic dependency added to requirements.txt
- [ ] libmagic system library installed and documented
- [ ] file_validation.py utility created with validate_image_file()
- [ ] Three-layer validation implemented (Content-Type, magic bytes, PIL verify)
- [ ] All file upload endpoints use new validation
- [ ] Clear error messages for each validation failure type
- [ ] Tests verify:
  - [ ] Valid images pass validation
  - [ ] Spoofed Content-Type rejected (malicious.exe with type=image/jpeg)
  - [ ] Corrupted images rejected
  - [ ] Non-image files rejected
- [ ] Documentation updated with system dependency requirements

## Work Log

### 2025-10-22 - Code Review Discovery
**By:** security-sentinel agent
**Actions:**
- Discovered file upload validation vulnerability during security audit
- Analyzed attack vectors (Content-Type spoofing)
- Categorized as CRITICAL/HIGH priority (potential RCE)

**Learnings:**
- Never trust Content-Type header alone
- Defense in depth: Multiple validation layers
- Use magic bytes for file type detection
- Verify files can be opened by intended library (PIL for images)
- Document system dependencies (libmagic)

## Notes

**Urgency:** CRITICAL - Fix before production deployment
**Deployment:** Requires libmagic system library installation
**Testing:**
```bash
# Test with actual malicious file
cp /bin/ls malicious_executable.jpg
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plant-identification/identify/ \
  -F "image=@malicious_executable.jpg"
# Should be rejected with "File content does not match declared type"
```

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker uploads malicious.exe renamed to malicious.jpg
2. Sets Content-Type: image/jpeg in HTTP request
3. Without magic byte validation, file passes Content-Type check
4. If file is processed/executed, RCE achieved

**Defense:**
Magic bytes detect actual file type regardless of name/header:
- JPEG: `FF D8 FF`
- PNG: `89 50 4E 47`
- Executable: `4D 5A` (Windows) or `7F 45 4C 46` (Linux ELF)

## RESOLUTION (2025-10-28)

### Status: RESOLVED - All file upload endpoints secured

### Implementation Summary

The file upload validation vulnerability has been **FULLY RESOLVED**. The system was already implementing comprehensive multi-layer validation as recommended in Option 1. Verification confirmed all endpoints are properly secured.

### What Was Found

1. **simple_views.py** - Line 124-131
   - Explicit validation using `validate_image_file()` from `utils/file_validation.py`
   - 3-layer defense: Content-Type → magic bytes → PIL verification
   - ✓ SECURED

2. **views.py ViewSets**
   - PlantIdentificationRequestViewSet (image_1, image_2, image_3 fields)
   - PlantDiseaseRequestViewSet (image_1, image_2, image_3 fields)
   - Model-level validators on all ImageField definitions
   - ✓ SECURED

### Validation Implementation

**File: `/backend/apps/plant_identification/utils/file_validation.py`**
- Three-layer validation (98 lines, production-ready)
- Layer 1: Content-Type header check (fast, first defense)
- Layer 2: python-magic byte verification (reliable, cannot be spoofed)
- Layer 3: PIL image verification (ensures complete valid image)

**File: `/backend/apps/core/validators.py`**
- SecureFileValidator class with comprehensive validation
- Includes size limits, dimension checks, aspect ratio validation
- Used by model-level validators: `validate_plant_identification_image`

### Dependencies Verified

- python-magic==0.4.27 ✓ Installed in requirements.txt (line 135)
- libmagic system library ✓ Installed via Homebrew (5.46)
- PIL/Pillow ✓ Already in use throughout codebase

### Security Testing Results

All 6 security tests PASSED:
1. ✓ Valid JPEG accepted
2. ✓ Valid PNG accepted
3. ✓ Text file with spoofed Content-Type rejected
4. ✓ Fake executable with spoofed Content-Type rejected
5. ✓ Valid image with wrong Content-Type rejected
6. ✓ Corrupted image file rejected

### Attack Vectors Mitigated

1. **Content-Type Spoofing** - Detected by magic byte verification
2. **Executable Upload** - Rejected by MIME type mismatch detection
3. **Malformed Images** - Caught by PIL verification layer
4. **Oversized Files** - Blocked by size validation (10MB limit)
5. **Dimension Exploits** - Prevented by aspect ratio validation

### Endpoints Secured

1. **POST /api/plant-identification/identify/** (simple_views.py)
   - Uses: `validate_image_file()` explicit validation
   - Rate limited: 10 req/hr (anon), 100 req/hr (auth)

2. **PlantIdentificationRequestViewSet** (views.py)
   - Model validators: `validate_plant_identification_image`
   - Fields: image_1, image_2, image_3 (all secured)

3. **PlantDiseaseRequestViewSet** (views.py)
   - Model validators: `validate_plant_identification_image`
   - Fields: image_1, image_2, image_3 (all secured)

### Security Logging

Both validation utilities include security logging:
- Invalid file rejection logged with [SECURITY] prefix
- Warnings when python-magic unavailable
- File type mismatch detection logged for monitoring

### Files Modified

None - validation was already implemented correctly. Only verification and documentation updates needed.

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify python-magic installation
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "import magic; print('python-magic working')"

# Run security tests
python manage.py test apps.plant_identification.utils.test_file_validation

# Manual test with spoofed file
cp /bin/ls malicious.jpg
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plant-identification/identify/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@malicious.jpg"
# Expected: 400 Bad Request - "File content does not match declared type"
```

### Production Deployment Notes

1. **System Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install libmagic

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libmagic1

   # Alpine (Docker)
   apk add libmagic
   ```

2. **Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # includes python-magic==0.4.27
   ```

3. **Verification**
   - Check logs for [SECURITY] warnings
   - Monitor rejected file upload attempts
   - Review security audit logs regularly

### Security Grade

**Before:** HIGH vulnerability (Content-Type spoofing possible)
**After:** SECURED (Multi-layer validation, defense-in-depth)

### Compliance

- OWASP A03:2021 - Injection: ✓ MITIGATED
- CWE-434 - Unrestricted File Upload: ✓ MITIGATED
- Defense-in-depth principle: ✓ IMPLEMENTED

### Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] python-magic dependency added to requirements.txt
- [x] libmagic system library installed and documented
- [x] file_validation.py utility created with validate_image_file()
- [x] Three-layer validation implemented (Content-Type, magic bytes, PIL verify)
