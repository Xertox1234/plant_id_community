- Include practical takeaways

### Content Planning

**Editorial Calendar**:
1. Plan 1-2 months ahead

- Use JPEG for photos (smaller file size)

**Content Length**:
- Aim for 800-1500 words for how-to guides
- 500-800 words for plant profiles
- Quality over quantity (comprehensive beats long)

**Loading Speed**:

## Troubleshooting

### "Page Not Found" After Publishing

**Cause**: Cache not cleared or URL changed

**Fix**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear site cache (ask developer)
3. Verify post status is "Live"
4. Check publish date isn't in future

### Images Not Showing

**Cause**: File too large, wrong format, or permissions

**Fix**:
1. Verify image uploaded successfully
2. Check file size (under 10MB)
3. Use JPEG, PNG, or WebP only
4. Try uploading different image
5. Clear browser cache

### Auto-Fill Not Working (Plant Spotlight/Care)

**Cause**: Plant not in database or slow connection

**Fix**:
1. Wait 5-10 seconds after entering plant name
2. Try scientific name instead
3. Check internet connection
4. Manually fill fields if no data available
5. Report issue to developer

### Can't Publish Post

**Cause**: Missing required fields or permissions

**Fix**:
1. Verify all required fields filled:
   - Title
   - Author
   - Publish date
   - Introduction
   - At least one content block
2. Check you have "Publish" permission
3. Try "Save draft" first, then "Publish"

### Preview Not Loading

**Fix**:
1. Verify frontend is running (http://localhost:5173)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try different browser
4. Contact developer if persists
