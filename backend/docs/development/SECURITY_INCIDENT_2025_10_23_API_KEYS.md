# Security Incident: API Keys Exposed in Git History

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 7.5)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (Verified 2025-10-27)
**Issue:** [#1 - Rotate exposed API keys and remove from git history](https://github.com/Xertox1234/plant_id_community/issues/1)

## Summary

API keys for Plant.id and PlantNet services were inadvertently committed to the public GitHub repository in the `CLAUDE.md` file, exposing them in the git history since the initial commit.

## Exposed Credentials

### Plant.id API Key
- **Key:** `W3YvEk2rx8g7Ko3fa8hKrlPJVqQeT2muIfikhKqvSBnaIUkXd4`
- **Service:** Plant.id (Kindwise) - Primary plant identification service
- **Limit:** 100 identifications/month (free tier)
- **First Exposure:** Initial commit `e43a7e1` (2025-10-XX)
- **Files:** `CLAUDE.md`, various documentation files

### PlantNet API Key
- **Key:** `2b10XCJNMzrPYiojVsddjK0n`
- **Service:** PlantNet - Supplemental plant identification
- **Limit:** 500 requests/day (free tier)
- **First Exposure:** Initial commit `e43a7e1` (2025-10-XX)
- **Files:** `CLAUDE.md`, various documentation files

### Django SECRET_KEY
- **Key:** `django-insecure-dev-key-change-in-production-2024`
- **Risk:** Session hijacking, CSRF bypass, authentication bypass
- **Status:** Development key, but should be rotated for security best practices

### JWT_SECRET_KEY
- **Key:** `jwt-dev-secret-key-change-in-production-2024`
- **Risk:** JWT token forgery, complete authentication bypass
- **Status:** Development key, but should be rotated for security best practices

Same commit history as Plant.id key (both keys were committed together).

## Impact Assessment

### Actual Risk
- **Repository Status:** PUBLIC on GitHub
- **Exposure Window:** ~7 days (from initial commit to fix)
- **Access:** Anyone with internet access could view the keys
- **Evidence of Abuse:** None detected (no unusual API usage reported)

### Potential Risk
1. **API Quota Exhaustion**
   - Plant.id: 100 requests/month = could be exhausted in minutes
   - PlantNet: 500 requests/day = could be exhausted in hours

2. **Service Disruption**
   - Legitimate users blocked if quota exhausted
   - Development and testing halted

3. **Financial Impact**
   - If free tier exceeded, potential charges to account owner
   - Cost to obtain new API keys (if service requires payment)

4. **Django/JWT Security**
   - Development keys only, but demonstrates poor security practices
   - Could indicate other secrets also exposed

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Repository Code Fixes (This PR)
- ✅ Removed `CLAUDE.md` from repository (local development file only)
- ✅ Added `CLAUDE.md` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Updated `backend/.env.example` with secret key generation instructions
- ✅ Verified `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and `CLAUDE.md` files
- ✅ Documented security incident in `/backend/docs/development/`
- ✅ Verified no `.env` or `CLAUDE.md` files tracked in git

### 2. Required User Actions (URGENT - Within 24 Hours)

#### Step 1: Rotate Plant.id API Key
```bash
# Visit: https://web.plant.id/account
# Navigate to: API Keys → Revoke old key → Generate new key
# Save the new key (shown only once)
```

#### Step 2: Rotate PlantNet API Key
```bash
# Contact PlantNet support or use account dashboard
# Request new API key and revoke old one
```

#### Step 3: Generate New Django SECRET_KEY
```bash
python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
# Output: 50+ character random string
```

#### Step 4: Generate New JWT_SECRET_KEY
```bash
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))'
# Output: 64+ character random string
```

#### Step 5: Update Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Update your production environment (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
# DO NOT commit these to git!
export PLANT_ID_API_KEY="new_key_here"
export PLANTNET_API_KEY="new_key_here"
export SECRET_KEY="new_django_secret_key_here"
export JWT_SECRET_KEY="new_jwt_secret_key_here"
```

#### Step 6: Verify Keys Work
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
# Test plant identification endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/plant-identification/identify/health/
```

### 3. Git History Cleanup (Optional - Requires Coordination)

**WARNING:** This rewrites git history and requires all team members to re-clone!

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo
pip install git-filter-repo

# Backup repository
cd ..
cp -r plant_id_community plant_id_community.backup

cd plant_id_community

# Option 1: Remove specific file from entire history
git filter-repo --path CLAUDE.md --invert-paths --force

# Option 2: Replace API keys with placeholders (safer)
git filter-repo --replace-text <(echo 'W3YvEk2rx8g7Ko3fa8hKrlPJVqQeT2muIfikhKqvSBnaIUkXd4==>YOUR_PLANT_ID_API_KEY_HERE')
git filter-repo --replace-text <(echo '2b10XCJNMzrPYiojVsddjK0n==>YOUR_PLANTNET_API_KEY_HERE')

# Force push (coordinate with team first!)
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

**Team Communication Required:**
- Notify all team members 24 hours before force push
- All team members must delete local repo and re-clone after force push
- Update any CI/CD pipelines that cache repository

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate (Completed)
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` to use placeholders
- ✅ Verified `.env` files in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with generation instructions
- ✅ Documented security incident

### Short-term (Within 1 Week)
- [ ] Enable GitHub secret scanning
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook to detect secrets
- [ ] Setup environment variable validation in CI/CD
- [ ] Create secrets management policy

### Long-term (Within 1 Month)
- [ ] Implement secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] Quarterly key rotation policy
- [ ] Monitor API usage for anomalies
- [ ] Security awareness training for team

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never commit real API keys** - Even in documentation files
2. **Review documentation files** - `CLAUDE.md` treated as "just docs" but contained secrets
3. **Pre-commit hooks** - Could have caught this before initial commit
4. **Public vs Private repos** - Extra vigilance needed for public repositories
5. **Secret scanning** - GitHub offers free secret scanning for public repos
