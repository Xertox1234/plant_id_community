# Documentation Review Patterns - Codified from Blog Docs Session

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Session Context:** Wagtail blog documentation creation (3 files, 3,000+ lines)
**Trigger:** Forgot to invoke code-review-specialist before committing documentation
**Issue:** User had to remind about mandatory review (codified in CLAUDE.md)
**Resolution:** Review found 4 high-priority issues, all fixed

---

## Executive Summary

This document codifies patterns learned from a code review session where comprehensive technical documentation was created without review, committed, and then reviewed after user reminder. The review found 4 high-priority accuracy issues that required fixes and a second commit.

**Key Learning:** Technical documentation requires the same rigor as code review, BEFORE committing.

---

## The Incident - What Happened

### Timeline

1. **Created 3 comprehensive documentation files:**
   - `backend/docs/blog/API_REFERENCE.md` (1,200+ lines)
   - `backend/docs/blog/STREAMFIELD_BLOCKS.md` (800+ lines)
   - `backend/docs/blog/ADMIN_GUIDE.md` (1,000+ lines)
   - `backend/docs/README.md` (updated with blog section)

2. **Committed and pushed without review:**
   - Commit: `ea96565 "docs: add comprehensive Wagtail blog documentation"`
   - Forgot mandatory code-review-specialist invocation

3. **User reminder:**
   - "you forgot to call the code review agent... I am sick of this. I wrote it in the claude.md file AND codified it."
   - User correctly pointed out this is MANDATORY, not optional

4. **Review invoked (should have been step 2):**
   - Found 4 high-priority issues requiring fixes
   - Grade: A- (91/100) with actionable fixes

5. **Fixed issues and committed again:**
   - Commit: `905e4d8 "fix: correct performance metrics and authentication details in blog docs"`
   - Messy git history with "fix after review" commit

### What Should Have Happened

```
1. Create documentation files (3,000+ lines)
2. 🚨 INVOKE code-review-specialist (BEFORE committing)
3. Fix 4 high-priority issues found
4. Commit clean documentation with accurate metrics
5. Single clean commit, no "fix after review" needed
```

## Patterns Identified - Documentation Review Requirements

### Pattern 1: Documentation Needs Review Too

**Rule:** Technical documentation (API docs, architecture docs, implementation guides) requires code review BEFORE committing.

**Why it's needed:**
- Documentation contains technical claims (metrics, performance, features)
- Code examples must match actual implementation
- Feature status must be accurate (implemented vs planned)
- Documentation is code for humans - errors are bugs

**Trigger:**
- Creating or modifying *.md files with technical content
- API documentation, architecture docs, implementation guides
- Any documentation with code examples or performance claims

**Anti-pattern:**
```
❌ Create docs → Commit → User reviews → Find issues → Fix commit
```

**Correct pattern:**
```
✅ Create docs → Code review → Fix issues → Commit clean docs
```

### Pattern 2: Pre-Commit Review Timing

**Rule:** Code review must happen BEFORE the first git commit, not after.

**Why it matters:**
- Clean git history (one commit, not "fix after review" commit)
- Issues caught before becoming permanent history
- Less work (fix before commit vs fix, amend/new commit)
- User satisfaction (no reminders needed)

**Visual workflow:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Write code/docs      │
└─────────────────────────┘
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 2. 🚨 CODE REVIEW 🚨    │  ← STEP 2, not STEP 4!
└─────────────────────────┘
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Fix issues found     │
└─────────────────────────┘
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 4. Commit clean code    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Session example:**
- ❌ Created docs (step 1) → Committed (step 2) → Reviewed (step 3) → Fixed (step 4)
- ✅ Should be: Create docs (step 1) → Review (step 2) → Fix (step 3) → Commit (step 4)

### Pattern 3: Metric Accuracy - Constants.py is Authoritative

**Rule:** Performance metrics in documentation must align with constants.py definitions.

**Issue found:**
```markdown
# API_REFERENCE.md:39 (INCORRECT)
Performance: <20 queries for lists, 19 queries for details
```

**Why it's wrong:**
```python
# apps/blog/constants.py (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)
TARGET_BLOG_LIST_QUERIES = 15
TARGET_BLOG_DETAIL_QUERIES = 10
```

**Fix:**
```markdown
# API_REFERENCE.md:39 (CORRECTED)
Performance: Target <15 queries for lists, <10 queries for details
(actual may vary with prefetching)
```

**Pattern:**
1. Documentation references performance metrics
2. Check constants.py for authoritative values
3. Use exact values from constants.py
4. Distinguish "target" vs "actual" vs "measured"
5. Include variance explanation when applicable

**Cross-reference checklist:**
- [ ] Query count claims match TARGET_*_QUERIES constants
- [ ] Timeout values match *_TIMEOUT constants
- [ ] Cache TTL values match CACHE_TIMEOUT_* constants
- [ ] Rate limit values match RATELIMIT_* constants
- [ ] All numeric claims have source in constants.py

### Pattern 4: Authentication Status Clarity

**Rule:** Feature documentation must clearly distinguish implemented, planned, and future features.

**Issue found:**
```markdown
# API_REFERENCE.md:47-49 (AMBIGUOUS)
Authentication:
- Current: No authentication
- Future: JWT tokens
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Phase 3 already implemented preview token authentication
- "No authentication" contradicts existing implementation
- "Future: JWT" unclear if planned or aspirational

**Fix:**
```markdown
# API_REFERENCE.md:47-49 (CLEAR)
Authentication:
- Public endpoints: No authentication required
- Preview: Token-based (?preview_token=...) - IMPLEMENTED (Phase 3)
- Future: Full JWT authentication for user-specific content
```

**Pattern:**
- **Public endpoints**: "No authentication required"
- **Implemented features**: "IMPLEMENTED (Phase N): Feature description"
- **Planned features**: "PLANNED (Phase N): Feature description"
- **Future/aspirational**: "FUTURE: Feature description"
- **In development**: "IN DEVELOPMENT (Phase N): Feature description"

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Does "Current" accurately reflect implemented features?
- [ ] Does "Future" distinguish planned vs aspirational?
- [ ] Are phase numbers included for implemented features?
- [ ] Is there clear separation between working and planned?

### Pattern 5: Test Coverage Claims - Pass Rate vs Code Coverage

**Rule:** Distinguish "test pass rate" (tests passing) from "code coverage %" (lines executed).

**Issue found:**
```markdown
# README.md:22 (MISLEADING)
Blog: 100% test coverage, production-ready
```

**Why it's misleading:**
- "100% test coverage" implies code coverage percentage
- Actual meaning: 79/79 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Code coverage % not measured (would use coverage.py)

**Fix:**
```markdown
# README.md:22 (ACCURATE)
Blog: 100% test pass rate, comprehensive coverage, production-ready
```

**Pattern - Test Metrics:**

| Metric | Meaning | Example | Tool |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| **Test pass rate** | % of tests passing | "100% pass rate (79/79)" | pytest |
| **Code coverage** | % of lines executed | "85% code coverage" | coverage.py |
| **Comprehensive coverage** | Breadth of testing | "Unit + integration + E2E" | Manual assessment |
| **Test count** | Number of tests | "79 tests total" | pytest |

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] "Test coverage" claims specify pass rate or code coverage
- [ ] Percentages include denominator (79/79, not just 100%)
- [ ] Coverage tool mentioned if code coverage claimed
- [ ] "Comprehensive" explained (what's covered)

### Pattern 6: Cache Key Specification Completeness

**Rule:** Cache key documentation must include hash length, algorithm, and collision prevention details.

**Issue found:**
```markdown
# API_REFERENCE.md:702 (INCOMPLETE)
blog:list:{page}:{limit}:{filters_hash}
```

**Why it's incomplete:**
- Hash length not specified (8 chars? 16 chars? Full hash?)
- Algorithm not mentioned (MD5? SHA-256?)
- No collision prevention explanation

**Fix:**
```markdown
# API_REFERENCE.md:702 (COMPLETE)
blog:list:{page}:{limit}:{filters_hash}
(filters_hash: 16-char SHA-256 hash, 64-bit for collision prevention)
```

**Pattern - Complete cache key specification:**
```python
# Cache key structure
cache_key = f"prefix:{param1}:{param2}:{hash}"

# Documentation must include:
# 1. Hash algorithm: SHA-256 (not MD5, not unspecified)
# 2. Hash length: 16 characters (64 bits)
# 3. Collision prevention: Birthday paradox at ~5 billion combinations
# 4. Hash input: sorted(filters.items()) for order-independence
```

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Hash algorithm specified (SHA-256)
- [ ] Hash length specified (16 chars = 64 bits)
- [ ] Collision prevention explained
- [ ] Input normalization documented (sorted, canonical)

## Documentation-Specific Review Criteria

### 7 Categories of Documentation Issues

#### 1. Performance Metrics Accuracy

**Check:**
```bash
grep -nE "[0-9]+\s*(queries|ms|seconds|%)" docs/file.md
```

**Cross-reference:**
- Check constants.py for authoritative values
- Compare with actual measured performance
- Verify target vs actual is clearly distinguished

**Blocker examples:**
- Metrics don't match constants.py
- Aspirational metrics presented as current
- Missing variance explanation

#### 2. Feature Status Clarity

**Check:**
```bash
grep -niE "(current:|future:|planned:|implemented:)" docs/file.md
```

**Cross-reference:**
- Check git history for implementation commits
- Verify phase numbers match plan.md
- Confirm features are actually working

**Blocker examples:**
- "Current" describes unimplemented features
- "Future" describes already-implemented features
- Missing phase context

#### 3. Test Coverage Claims

**Check:**
```bash
grep -niE "(test coverage|tests? passing|% coverage)" docs/file.md
```

**Cross-reference:**
- Check test output for pass rate
- Verify if coverage.py used for code coverage
- Distinguish breadth (comprehensive) vs depth (%)

**Blocker examples:**
- "100% test coverage" without specifying pass rate vs code coverage
- Claiming coverage without measurement tool
- Confusing test count with coverage percentage

#### 4. Code Examples Accuracy

**Check:**
```bash
# Manually compare code blocks in docs with actual source files
```

**Cross-reference:**
- Copy-paste code from docs to verify syntax
- Check import paths match current structure
- Verify function signatures match implementation

**Blocker examples:**
- Import paths reference moved/renamed modules
- Function signatures don't match actual code
- Configuration examples use deprecated settings

#### 5. API Endpoint Versioning

**Check:**
```bash
grep -nE "/api/[^v]" docs/file.md  # Catches unversioned endpoints
```

**Cross-reference:**
- Check urls.py for actual endpoint structure
- Verify version numbers (v1, v2, etc.)
- Confirm examples match production

**Warning examples:**
- `/api/blog/posts/` should be `/api/v1/blog/posts/`
- Mixing versioned and unversioned in same doc
- Using wrong version (v2 when production is v1)

#### 6. Cache Key Specifications

**Check:**
```bash
grep -nE "cache.*key.*:" docs/file.md
```

**Cross-reference:**
- Check service files for actual cache key structure
- Verify hash algorithm and length in implementation
- Confirm collision prevention strategy

**Warning examples:**
- Missing hash length specification
- No algorithm mentioned
- Incomplete collision explanation

#### 7. Cross-References Validation

**Check:**
```bash
grep -nE "(See:|see also|refer to|documented in)" docs/file.md -i
```

**Cross-reference:**
- Verify file paths exist
- Check section anchors are correct
- Confirm version references are current

**Warning examples:**
- File paths that don't exist
- Section anchors that don't match
- Outdated version references

## Practical Examples - Real Session Fixes

### Example 1: Performance Metrics Fix

**File:** `backend/docs/blog/API_REFERENCE.md:39`

**Before (incorrect):**
```markdown
## Performance

Query optimization with conditional prefetching:
- <20 queries for lists
- 19 queries for details
```

**Review finding:**
```
❌ BLOCKER: Line 39 - Performance metrics don't match constants.py

constants.py defines:
  TARGET_BLOG_LIST_QUERIES = 15
  TARGET_BLOG_DETAIL_QUERIES = 10

Documentation claims "<20" and "19" which don't align with targets.
```

**After (corrected):**
```markdown
## Performance

Query optimization with conditional prefetching:
- Target <15 queries for lists (actual may vary with prefetching)
- Target <10 queries for details (actual may vary with prefetching)

Based on constants.py:
  TARGET_BLOG_LIST_QUERIES = 15
  TARGET_BLOG_DETAIL_QUERIES = 10
```

**Key learning:**
- constants.py is authoritative source
- Use "target" language for goals
- Include variance explanation for dynamic behavior
- Reference source file for traceability

### Example 2: Authentication Clarity Fix

**File:** `backend/docs/blog/API_REFERENCE.md:47-49`

**Before (ambiguous):**
```markdown
## Authentication

- Current: No authentication
- Future: JWT authentication for user-specific content
```

**Review finding:**
```
❌ BLOCKER: Line 47-49 - Authentication status inaccurate

Phase 3 implemented preview token authentication:
  ?preview_token=... for draft/unpublished content

Documentation says "No authentication" which contradicts implementation.
```

**After (clear):**
```markdown
## Authentication

- **Public endpoints**: No authentication required (published content)
- **Preview mode**: Token-based authentication (IMPLEMENTED - Phase 3)
  - Draft content: `?preview_token=...`
  - Unpublished content: `?preview_token=...`
- **Future**: Full JWT authentication for user-specific content (PLANNED)
```

**Key learning:**
- Distinguish public, implemented, and future
- Include phase context for implemented features
- Use status markers: IMPLEMENTED, PLANNED, FUTURE
- Provide examples for implemented features

### Example 3: Cache Key Specification Fix

**File:** `backend/docs/blog/API_REFERENCE.md:702`

**Before (incomplete):**
```markdown
### Cache Keys

Blog lists: `blog:list:{page}:{limit}:{filters_hash}`
```

**Review finding:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Line 702 - Cache key hash not fully specified

Missing:
- Hash length (how many characters?)
- Algorithm (SHA-256? MD5?)
- Collision prevention explanation
```

**After (complete):**
```markdown
### Cache Keys

Blog lists: `blog:list:{page}:{limit}:{filters_hash}`

Where:
- `filters_hash`: 16-character SHA-256 hash (64 bits)
- Collision prevention: ~5 billion combinations before 50% collision probability
- Input: `sorted(filters.items())` for order-independence
```

**Key learning:**
- Specify hash algorithm (SHA-256)
- Include hash length (16 chars = 64 bits)
- Explain collision prevention (birthday paradox)
- Document input normalization

### Example 4: Test Coverage Claim Fix

**File:** `backend/docs/README.md:22`

**Before (misleading):**
```markdown
- ✅ **Blog (Wagtail CMS)**: 100% test coverage, production-ready
```

**Review finding:**
```
❌ BLOCKER: Line 22 - "100% test coverage" misleading

Actual meaning: 79/79 tests passing (100% pass rate)
NOT: 100% code coverage (which would need coverage.py)

Users will interpret this as code coverage percentage.
```

**After (accurate):**
```markdown
- ✅ **Blog (Wagtail CMS)**: 100% test pass rate (79/79), comprehensive coverage, production-ready
```

**Key learning:**
- "Test coverage" can mean pass rate OR code coverage %
- Always specify which metric you mean
- Include test count for context (79/79)
- Use "comprehensive coverage" for breadth, not %
