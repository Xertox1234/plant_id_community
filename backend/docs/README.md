## Documentation Structure

### Quick Wins Implementation
**Location:** [`quick-wins/`](./quick-wins/)

Production-readiness improvements implemented in Week 3. Includes authentication, API versioning, circuit breakers, and distributed locks.

- [Quick Wins Overview](./quick-wins/README.md) - Executive summary and implementation guide
- [Authentication Strategy](./quick-wins/authentication.md) - Environment-aware authentication and rate limiting
- [API Versioning](./quick-wins/api-versioning.md) - URL versioning strategy (/api/v1/)
- [Circuit Breaker Pattern](./quick-wins/circuit-breaker.md) - Fast-fail protection for external APIs
- [Distributed Locks](./quick-wins/distributed-locks.md) - Cache stampede prevention

**Impact Summary:**
- 99.97% faster failed API responses (30s → <10ms)
- 90% reduction in duplicate API calls
- Production authentication protecting API quota
- Safe API evolution with versioning
